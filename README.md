# shak3sp3ar3 - CSC590 final project

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, we’ll write a program that fills in the blanks of poems. In order to teach the project how poems work, we’ll feed the program a bunch of stanzas from Shakespearean sonnets. Then, we’ll give the program unfinished pop song lyrics and see what it does.
