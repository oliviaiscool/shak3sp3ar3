Machine Learning for Performers, Artists, and Poets

## PROJECT GOALS
Trained on Shakespeare, we’ll test how well a neural net can fill in the blanks to create coherent pop song lyrics. 

##DESCRIPTION
In this project, we’ll write a program that fills in the blanks of poems. In order to teach the project how poems work, we’ll feed the program a bunch of stanzas from Shakespearean sonnets with the words redacted, as well as the correct word for the blanks. Then, we’ll give the program unfinished pop song lyrics and see what it does.
