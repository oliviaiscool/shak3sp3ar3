			+ " is of my wailing chief, A loss"
			+ " in love that touches me more nearly. "
			+ "Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,"
			+ " Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I "
			+ "love her, And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
			+ " Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her."
			+ " If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, And"
			+ " losing her, my friend hath found that loss, Both"
			+ " find each other, and I lose both twain,And both"
			+ " for my sake lay on me this cross, But here's the"
			+ " joy, my friend and I are one, Sweet flattery,"
			+ " then she loves but me alone. Was it the proud full "
			+ "sail of his great verse, Bound for the "
			+ "prize of (all too precious) you, That "
			+ "did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, "
			+ "Making their tomb the womb wherein they "
			+ "grew? Was it his spirit, by spirits taught "
			+ "to write, Above a mortal pitch, that struck"
			+ " me dead? No, neither he, nor his compeers"

			+ "cannot boast, I was not sick of any fear"
			+ " from thence. But when your countenance "
			+ "filled up his line, Then lacked I matter, "
			+ "that enfeebled mine. Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, "
			+ "My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,But now my gracious"
			+ " numbers are decayed, And my sick muse doth give an other place."
			+ "I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a "
			+ "worthier pen, Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, He robs thee of, "
			+ "and pays it thee again, He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word, "
			+ "From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give And found it in thy "
			+ "cheek: he can afford No praise to thee, but what in thee doth "
			+ "live. Then thank him not for that which he say, Since what he owes "
			+ "thee, thou thy self dost pay. Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, My sinful earth these rebel powers array,Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? Why so large cost "
			+ "having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?"
			+ " Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge? is this"
			+ " thy body's end? Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss, And "
			+ "let that pine to aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine in selling"
			+ " hours of dross; within be fed, without be rich no more, So "
			+ "shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men, And death once "
			+ "dead, there's no more dying then. Love is too young to know what conscience is, Yet who knows not "
			+ "conscience is born of love? Then gentle "
			+ "cheater urge not my amiss, Lest guilty of my faults thy "
			+ "sweet self prove. For thou betraying me, I do betray My nobler "
			+ "part to my gross body's treason, My soul doth tell my body that"
			+ " he may, Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason, But rising "
			+ "at thy name doth point out thee, As his triumphant prize, proud of this "
			+ "pride, He is contented thy poor drudge to be, To stand in thy affairs, fall "
			+ "by thy side. No want of conscience hold it that I call, Her love, for whose"
			+ " dear love I rise and fall.";
